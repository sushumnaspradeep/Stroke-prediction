# Stroke-prediction
Introduction:
Stroke remains a significant global health concern, posing a substantial threat to life and quality of life. The timely identification of individuals at an elevated risk of experiencing a stroke is paramount for implementing interventions that can mitigate its impact on both individuals and the healthcare system. This project proposes a machine learning framework for stroke prediction, employing a triad of classifiers - Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost - to construct a robust and precise predictive model.

Dataset:
For evaluating our approach, we harnessed a stroke prediction dataset from Kaggle, encompassing 5110 rows and 11 attributes. Rigorous data preprocessing, including cleaning, normalization, encoding, and feature selection, was undertaken to optimize the dataset for model training.

Methodology:
The construction of our predictive model involved the utilization of three diverse classifiers - Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning was implemented to identify the optimal set of parameters tailored to the stroke dataset, enhancing the overall accuracy of our predictive model.

Performance Metrics:
The evaluation of our model's performance relied on key metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F-measure. The outcomes revealed that Random Forest exhibited the highest accuracy among the classifiers, reaching 95.8%, followed closely by Decision Tree at 95.7%, and XGBoost with an accuracy of 95.1%. These results underscore the potential of these classifiers for stroke prediction and underscore the necessity for continued exploration in this domain.

Future Work:
The implications of this study extend to the advancement of more precise and efficient stroke prediction models, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes and alleviating the strain on healthcare resources. Future endeavors should concentrate on diversifying datasets, integrating the model with Electronic Health Records, and exploring the incorporation of CT scan images of the brain to further refine the accuracy of stroke prediction.

Conclusion:
In summary, our study introduces an innovative approach to stroke prediction, demonstrating efficacy in identifying individuals at heightened risk of stroke and facilitating timely interventions. The superior accuracy achieved by our model compared to existing approaches underscores its potential for accurately predicting stroke occurrences in patients, signifying a noteworthy advancement in this critical area of healthcare research.
